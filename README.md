# AquaTallyApp (Java Desktop)

A useful fishing utility desktop app built in pure Java (Swing).
It will fetch weather/tide info and lets you log catches and fishing spots locally (coming soon).

## Requirements
- Java 17+ (tested with 21)
- Internet connection for API lookups
- SQLite JDBC embedded (no separate DB install needed)

## Quick Start
```bash
./gradlew run
